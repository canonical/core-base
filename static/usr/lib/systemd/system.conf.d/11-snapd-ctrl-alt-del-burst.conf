# Snapd allows control of the systemd ctrl-alt-del action
# by controlling the ctrl-alt-del.target unit (masking it)
#
# For example: 
# snap set core system.ctrl-alt-del-action=none
#
# However, systemd implements a parallel emergency action
# mechanism which still, by default, allows the user to
# trigger a forced reset by hitting ctrl-alt-del 7 times
# or more in 2 seconds. Let's make sure this loophole is
# closed by changing the action to none.
#
# The ability to disable this was added in systemd 231, so
# this can only be disabled in Ubuntu Core 18 and later.
