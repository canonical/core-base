#
# /usr/bin/pager -> /etc/alternatives/pager -> /bin/more

# Do this by:
# 1. find symlinks "f" into /etc/alternatives/
#    e.g. /usr/bin/pager -> /etc/alternatives/pager
# 2. get the symlink "target" of the links
#    e.g. /etc/alternatives/pager -> /bin/less
# 3. link original symlink "f" directly to target of alternatives,
#    and use a relative link, e.g. /usr/bin/pager -> ../bin/less
